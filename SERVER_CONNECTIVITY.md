# Server Connectivity Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to handle server connectivity issues in the DocBook application, particularly for deployment environments like Vercel where direct file system access is restricted.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Handling

We've implemented a robust database initialization and access system to ensure the application works correctly in serverless environments:

- Created `lib/db-seed.ts` with initial data and helper functions:
  - `ensureDbExists()`: Ensures the database file exists before operations
  - `getDbData()`: Safely retrieves data from the database
  - `writeDbData()`: Safely writes data to the database

- Updated all API routes to use these helper functions instead of direct file system access

### 2. API Improvements

- Added cache control headers to prevent stale data issues
- Implemented retry mechanisms in API calls
- Added timeout handling to prevent hanging requests
- Created a `/api/debug` endpoint for diagnostics

### 3. Error Handling

- Enhanced the `ServerStatus` component with better error messages
- Added a "Retry" button to allow users to quickly retry connections
- Linked to a diagnostic page for more detailed troubleshooting

### 4. Diagnostics

- Enhanced the debug page with comprehensive server status information
- Added database status indicators
- Improved troubleshooting guidance

## Middleware

We've updated the middleware to add cache control headers to all API responses, preventing caching issues that could lead to stale data.

## Testing Connectivity

To test server connectivity:

1. Visit the `/debug` page to see detailed diagnostics
2. Check the server status indicator in the application
3. Use the "Retry" button if connection issues occur

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter server connectivity issues:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try a different browser
4. Visit the `/debug` page for detailed diagnostics
5. Check if the server is running correctly
6. Verify your login credentials

## Technical Implementation

### API Fetch with Retry Logic

We've implemented a `fetchWithRetry` helper in `lib/api.ts` that provides:

- Automatic retries for failed requests
- Timeout handling
- Cache control headers

### Server Status Component

The `ServerStatus` component now:

- Uses the debug endpoint for better diagnostics
- Provides more helpful error messages
- Includes a link to the debug page
- Has a retry button for quick reconnection attempts

### Debug Endpoint

The `/api/debug` endpoint provides comprehensive information about:

- Server status
- Database existence and record counts
- Environment information
- Detailed error messages when issues occur
